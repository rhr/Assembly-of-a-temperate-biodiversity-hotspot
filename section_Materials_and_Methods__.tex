\subsection{Clade selection and phylogeny reconstruction}

We selected 18 clades of vascular plants that best met our criteria: (1) includes a substantial number of species that occur in the Hengduan Mountains, as well as species that occur elsewhere; (2) has sufficient molecular data available to infer a phylogeny that is broadly representative of the clade's taxonomic diversity and geographic range; and (3) has fossil data suitable for molecular clock calibration. The clades include angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns, and together include XXX species, of which YYY were sampled for phylogeny reconstruction. For each clade,
