\section{Discussion}

Our analysis is the first to make quantitative temporal inferences about the relative contributions of \textit{in situ} lineage diversification and colonization to the assembly of one of the world's richest temperate floras. Despite precedent in the literature for considering the Hengduan Mountains to be simply part of a greater biogeographic region that includes the Himalayas and QTP \citep[e.g.][]{Zhang2014,Nie2013,GaoY2013,Matuszak2016}, we instead find that the Hengduan region actually has a very distinct history of assembly that reflects its younger age.

We expected regional differences to reflect contrasting times of orogeny: in particular, the uplift-driven diversification hypothesis predicts that \textit{in situ} speciation increases with mountain-building activity. In this context the late Miocene (12--8 Ma) is an important reference point, as previous studies of geology and paleontology indicate that the Hengduan Mountains achieved their current height only after this time, while the Himalayas and central QTP did so before (REFS). Here, our neontological analyses, which make no prior assumptions about about the timing of geological events, show that after about 8 Ma, the rate of \textit{in situ} speciation increased in the Hengduan Mountains, yielding a remarkable inflection point at which cumulative speciation overtakes colonization. This indicates that the Hengduan Mountains flora has been assembled disproportionately by recent \textit{in situ} speciation that coincides temporally with independent estimates of orogeny, supporting the uplift-driven diversification hypothesis.

We do not find a similar signature of accelerated \textit{in situ} speciation for the Himalayas-QTP region, as might be expected from rapid Himalayan orogeny during the early to middle Miocene (REFS)  % \citep{WangY2007,Mao2010}
. It is possible that no such pulse of diversification occurred, e.g., if Himalayan uplift was more gradual. Alternatively, we could simply lack the statistical power to detect it, due to the masking effects of lumping the older QTP with the younger Himalayas, the greater uncertainty associated with estimating clade ages and ancestral ranges in deeper time, and/or extinction and turnover in the Himalayas-QTP flora.

% From Fig.2, speciation rate of Himalayas also increased until around 8 Ma, and keep constant since then. This probably due to Himalayas already reached its current elevation.

The older age of the Himalayas-QTP predicts that its flora should have been an early source of lineage dispersal to the younger Hengduan Mountains, which acted as a colonization sink. However, our results do not show any marked asymmetry in dispersal between these regions through the end of the Miocene; instead, rates in both directions are relatively low and increase only gradually until about 2--3 Ma, when both increase more sharply, but more so from the Hengduan Mountains to the Himalayas-QTP (Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersal}). That is, in the Quaternary, the Hengduan Mountains appear to have acted more as a biogeographic \textit{source} than a sink for the Himalayas-QTP; this is reflected in phylogeographic evidence that lineages in the Hengduan Mountains were likely buffered from extinction during Quaternary glacial cycles, and expanded their ranges by westward recolonization of the Himalayas and QTP \citep[e.g.,][]{WangBS2011,CunY2010}. 

%Surpringly, our results indicate Himalayas-QTP flora was assembled later (Fig **). Ideally, bring paleontological evidence to bear on assembly/diversification questions - but the record is sparse. The exact time of onset of current biome remains unclear.

\textbf{Lack of correspondence between dispersal and shifts in diversification.}---Given the regional analysis showing increasing dominance of \textit{in situ} speciation over colonization in the Hengduan Mountains since the late Miocene, the lack of evidence for macroevolutionary jumps in diversification rate  associated with colonization of the Hengduan region might seem contradictory. However, across our phylogenies we observe a high degree of geographic homoplasy, i.e., dispersal is relatively frequent and clades tend not to be entirely endemic to a single region. This likely reflects the fact that our regions are not, in general, defined by differences in biome, meaning that dispersal does not require extensive ecophysiological adaptations that may be difficult to evolve \citep{Donoghue2014}. In particular, despite their differences in age, the Hengduan Mountains, Himalayas, and QTP share broad physiographic similarities that presumably facilitate biogeographic exchange. As a result, our data do not necessarily lend themselves to expectations of geographically restricted evolutionary radiations \citep[e.g.][]{Hughes2006}, and in that respect are perhaps not well-suited for analysis in the BAMM framework, which models shifts in diversification regime as relatively rare events. Moreover, the link between dispersal events and shifts in diversification regime is further obscured by the inherent uncertainty associated with inferring their phylogenetic locations. In this light, the BAMM results are perhaps most appropriately seen as inconclusive, neither confirming nor rejecting the region-specific rate analyses.

% Aridification and global cooling  as a result of orogeny (see reviews in \citealt{MiaoY2012}) may be an important factor influencing the diversification of plants on the QTP.

\textbf{Drivers of Hengduan diversification.}---Our results prompt a basic question: why did \textit{in situ} diversification in the Hengduan Mountains increase relative to adjacent regions since the late Miocene---what are the proximate causes, and to what extent can these be linked to orogeny? Keeping in mind that hypotheses should 

For example, when lineages move between regions, do they conserve their niches or not; and when they diversify within a region, along what environmental axes, if any, do they diverge? Here, we did not break down clades and species by habitat or niche preference, elevational range, or other ecological factors, but finer-scale dissection of these in the context of diversification and dispersal through time would likely be revealing. A hypothesis-testing framework such as that outlined by \citet{Favre2015} would be useful for this purpose.

Perenniality, woodiness are something like ``classic'' traits associated with alpine radiation (Hughes and Atchison) - but our clades include many herbaceous species. Hybridization (Rhododendron: Milne). Sky islands (e.g., Solms-Laubachia): does population isolation lead to the proliferation of narrow endemics (that are more prone to extinction)?

Younger clades like Saussurea - ecological opportunity of new alpine habitat?

Density-dependent effects: Himalayas are older, are niches more filled relative to Hengduan Mountains?

Pleistocene effects

Perhaps the Hengduan Mountains are simply wetter (higher productivity).

% Predict that earliest clades are montane, most recent radiations are alpine. Not entirely the case. Pinaceae, Acer, Delphineae are montane, and colonize early. Alpine clades like Saussurea and Ligularia colonized later and with exeptional high rates (Saussurea has crown age c. 3 Myr, but has generated more than 400 species). But Meconopsis(true???), Saxifragaceae, and Polygoneae have many alpine members (Saxifragaceae and Polygoneae include many montane even low land species as well), and are the earliest clades to accumulate \textit{in situ} speciation events in the Hengduan Mountains.

% Notably, clades that occur primarily in the relatively arid alpine zone, such as \textit{Saussurea} and \textit{Rhodiola}, show faster diversification in the past 10 Ma than montane clades such as Primulaceae (s.s.) and \textit{Cyananthus}. However, precipitation is not a limiting factor in north-south-going Hengduan Mountains since moist air from the Indian Ocean can go through by the valleys, facilitating diversification of montane clades like \textit{Rhododendron} and Primulaceae (s.s.). 

Limited paleontological evidence shows that the Himalayas-QTP may have experienced a dramatic species/vegetation shift after the middle Miocene. During the early to middle Miocene, the southern QTP was still covered by coniferous and deciduous-leaved forests \citep{SunJ2014,LiH1976} even paleoelevational recontruction suggesting this regions already reached their current elevation by then \citep{Spicer2003}. The onset and diversification of alpine biome may be much later than the uplift.


\textbf{Comparable analyses of other regions.}---% \textit{In situ} diversification also implicated in the assembly of other biodiversity hotspots: the Andes, California Floristic Province (Kay and Lancaster?), Cape Floristic Region? Uplift-driven diversification: Andes, Japan?
Rapid evolutionary radiations of plants have been documented in most major mountain ranges worldwide \citep[reviewed in][]{Hughes2015}, including the European Alps \citep{Roquet2013}, Andes \citep[e.g.][]{Hughes2006,Luebert2014}), Rocky Mountains \citep{DrummondC2012}, New Zealand \citep{Joly2014}, and the East African Rift mountains \citep{Linder2014}. Most of these have been dated to the last 5 Ma, conciding with or occurring much later than orogeny. Apparently, the Hengduan mountain radiation is older dating back to 8--10 Ma. Andes is comparable with the Himalayas-QTP and the Hengduan mountains in several ways. They habor the most alpine diversity among the mountain ranges. The initial uplift of Andes and QTP dated back to late Eocene \citep{Gregory-Wodzicki2000,Graham2009}, but plant radiations are more influenced by recent uplift (late Miocene and onwards) \citep{Hughes2013,Luebert2014,Hughes2015,Madrinan2013}. \citet{HughesC2013} pointed out that different biomes in the Neotropics may have different evolutionary histories. It is probably the case in the Himalayas-Hengduan Mountains as well. 


\textbf{Uplift-driven diversification is either a too-simplistic hypothesis} that fails to acknowledge the numerous other factors that likely contribute to biological diversification in mountains, or a too-vague catchall phrase that encompasses them all.

Here we have found temporal alignment of elevated diversification and orogeny, with evidence coming from the joint analysis of many clades, which suggests that uplift may have had a general effect. However 

This is complementary to studies that focus on 

\textbf{Sources of error and bias.}---Taxon sampling: incomplete, and in some cases not geographically representative (Saxifragaceae). However, our focus is on relative dynamics: comparing \textit{in situ} speciation to colonization (not absolute rates of either process) and comparing the Hengduan Mountains to the Himalayas, and both to the rest of temperate East Asia. So we generally expect the results to be unbiased with respect to our hypotheses.

Granularity. To place the biogeographic assembly of the Hengduan Mountains and adjacent regions in a global context, it was necessary to adjust the granularity of the geographic coding of species. In particlar, we lumped the Himalayas with the rest of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, creating a composite region of heterogeneous ages.
