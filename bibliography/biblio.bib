  volume = {99},

  pages = {311-322},
  abstract = {Background and Aims It is an enduring question as to the mechanisms leading to the high diversity and the processes producing endemics with unusual morphologies in the Himalayan alpine region. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships and origins of three such endemic genera were analysed, Dolomiaea, Diplazoptilon and Xanthopappus, all in the tribe Cardueae of Asteraceae.Methods The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnL-F and psbA-trnH regions of these three genera were sequenced. The same regions for other related genera in Cardueae were also sequenced or downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from individual and combined data sets of the three types of sequences using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.Key Results The phylogenetic tree obtained allowed earlier hypotheses concerning the relationships of these three endemic genera based on gross morphology to be rejected. Frolovia and Saussurea costus were deeply nested within Dolomiaea, and the strong statistical support for the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade suggested that circumscription of Dolomiaea should be more broadly redefined. Diplazoptilon was resolved as sister to Himalaiella, and these two together are sister to Lipschitziella. The clade comprising these three genera is sister to Jurinea, and together these four genera are sister to the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade. Xanthopappus, previously hypothesized to be closely related to Carduus, was found to be nested within a well-supported but not fully resolved Onopordum group with Alfredia, Ancathia, Lamyropappus, Olgaea, Synurus and Syreitschikovia, rather than the Carduus group. The crude dating based on ITS sequence divergence revealed that the divergence time of Dolomiaea–Frolovia from its sister group probably occurred 13·6–12·2 million years ago (Ma), and the divergence times of the other two genera, Xanthopappus and Diplazoptilon, from their close relatives around 5·7–4·7 Ma and 2·0–1·6 Ma, respectively.Conclusions The findings provide an improved understanding of the intergeneric relationships in Cardueae. The crude calibration of lineages indicates that the uplifts of the Qiinghai–Tibetan Plateau since the Miocene might have served as a continuous stimulus for the production of these morphologically aberrant endemic elements of the Himalayan flora.},

                  uplift of the Tibetan Plateau provided the
                  first-order driver for the aridification (moisture
                  levels) of Central Asia throughout the Mid–Late
                  Miocene, between about 17 and 5 Ma. This review
                  attempts to throw new light on the relations between
                  the aridification and these two key factors. This
                  paper examines the evolution of Miocene climate
                  (both moisture and temperature) within five separate
                  regions of Eurasia to help understand the large
                  scale controls of long-term moisture in Central
                  Asia. The five regions include: (1) Europe, (2)
                  high-latitude Asia, (3) the East Asian Monsoon
                  region, (4) the South Asian Monsoon region, and (5)
                  Central Asia itself, because moisture reaching
                  Central Asia has to firstly cross at least one of
                  the other four regions. Temperature proxy data
                  compiled from these five regions correlate with
                  ocean temperatures from the global deep-sea oxygen
                  isotope records. Furthermore, compiled moisture
                  proxy data from the four regions surrounding Central
                  Asia co-vary and correlate with each other. This can
                  be explained by positive feedbacks between drying
                  and cooling, and supports the assumption that global
                  cooling provides a dominant driving factor for the
                  drying of Eurasia: global cooling reduces the amount
                  of water vapor held in the atmosphere and thereby
                  can cause terrestrial drying. However, in Central
                  Asia the moisture evolution shows less similarity
                  with its surroundings. The uplift of the Tibetan
                  Plateau (including the Tianshan Mountains) could
                  provide a possible explanation for this
                  difference. The changing topography resulting from
                  uplift events over time and space strongly
                  influenced the moisture patterns in Central Asia
                  during Miocene times. Future research on the spatial
                  timing and amplitude of Tibetan Plateau uplift
                  should be useful to understand the moisture
                  processes in Central Asia during the Miocene.},

                  flank the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau
                  (Q–T Plateau) and are a center of great temperate
                  plant diversity. The geological history and complex
                  topography of these mountains may have prompted the
                  in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly
                  endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D
                  Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain
                  regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One
                  hypothesis is that the Q–T Plateau underwent a
                  final, rapid phase of uplift 8–7 million years ago
                  (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a
                  separate event occurring 4–3 Mya. To evaluate this
                  hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic,
                  biogeographic, divergence time dating, and
                  diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally
                  important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The
                  Lilium–Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout
                  the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most
                  diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q–T
                  Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support
                  previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested
                  within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence
                  between the two gene trees which may result from
                  hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the
                  ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major
                  lineages within Lilium–Nomocharis may be temporally
                  coincident with Q–T Plateau uplift occurring 8–7 Mya
                  and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4–3 Mya. Our
                  analyses of diversification times and rates among
                  Lilium–Nomocharis clades are less
                  conclusive. However, these do suggest high
                  extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.},

To orient this line of research we develop a conceptual framework in which the likelihood of a biome shift is a function of (a) exposure to contrasting environments over time, (b) the evolutionary accessibility of relevant adaptations, and (c) changing biotic interactions. We evaluate the literature on biome shifts in plants in relation to a set of hypotheses on the size, connectedness, and absolute age of biomes, as well as on the adaptability of particular lineages and ecological interactions over time. We also critique the phylogenetic inference of past biomes and a “global” model-based approach to biome evolution. More robust generalizations about biome shifts will require detailed studies of well-sampled and well-resolved clades, accounting for changes in the relevant abiotic and biotic factors through time.},

	abstract = {Aim: Montane regions like the Sino-Himalayas constitute global diversity hotspots. Various mechanisms such as in situ adaptive divergence, speciation following immigration or allopatric diversification in complex landscapes have been proposed to account for the exceptional diversity found in a particular clade in a montane setting. We investigated macroevolutionary patterns to test these different hypotheses in the continental radiation of a Sino-Himalayan bird group, the parrotbills (Paradoxornithidae). Location: Sino-Himalayan region, Indo-Burma. Methods: We used phylogenetic comparative methods based on a multilocus, time-calibrated phylogeny to reconstruct patterns of lineage diversification, biogeographical history, morphological evolution as well as of climate niche history using ecological niche modelling. Results: The radiation of parrotbills started c. 12 Ma, diversifying at an apparent constant rate over time. The biogeographical history appears to be complex, within-region speciation in mountains was restricted to China. Size evolution was concentrated in the early phase of parrotbill radiation, whereas morphological shape evolution did not differ from Brownian motion. We found no indication for niche conservatism, with climate niche evolution occurring throughout the radiation of parrotbills. Conclusions: Parrotbills diversified within a time span of increased regional orogenesis and associated strong climate change. While the south-west and central Chinese mountains were revealed to be a species pump, with in situ allopatric diversification triggered by complex topography and high habitat turnover, the diversity in the Himalayas was chiefly the result of immigration. Evidence for continuous ecological specialization and for the absence of climate niche conservatism could be interpreted as the consequence of ongoing climate- and habitat-induced ecological opportunities. The radiation of parrotbills demonstrates the influence of multiple drivers of diversification in a single group due to the dynamic geological and palaeoclimatic history of the Sino-Himalayan region and illustrates the complex nature of continental radiations.},

	abstract = {Andean orogeny is considered as one of the most important events for the development of current plant diversity in South America. We compare available phylogenetic studies and divergence time estimates for plant lineages that may have diversified in response to Andean orogeny. The influence of the Andes on plant diversification is separated into four major groups: The Andes as source of new high-elevation habitats, as a vicariant barrier, as a North-South corridor, and as generator of new environmental conditions outside the Andes. Biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other regions are also considered. Divergence time estimates indicate that high-elevation lineages originated and diversified during or after the major phases of Andean uplift (Mid-Miocene to Pliocene), although there are some exceptions. As expected, Andean mid-elevation lineages tend to be older than high-elevation groups. Most clades with disjunct distribution on both sides of the Andes diverged during Andean uplift. Inner-Andean clades also tend to have divergence time during or after Andean uplift. This is interpreted as evidence of vicariance. Dispersal along the Andes has been shown to occur in either direction, mostly dated after the Andean uplift. Divergence time estimates of plant groups outside the Andes encompass a wider range of ages, indicating that the Andes may not be necessarily the cause of these diversifications. The Andes are biogeographically related to all neighboring areas, especially Central America, with floristic interchanges in both directions since Early Miocene times. Direct biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other disjunct regions have also been shown in phylogenetic studies, especially with the eastern Brazilian highlands and North America. The history of the Andean flora is complex and plant diversification has been driven by a variety of processes, including environmental change, adaptation, and biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {The tropical Andes are a hotspot of biodiversity, but detailed altitudinal and latitudinal distribution patterns of species are poorly understood. We compare the distribution and diversity patterns of four Andean plant groups on the basis of georeferenced specimen data: the genus Nasa (Loasaceae), the two South American sections of Ribes (sect. Parilla and sect. Andina, Grossulariaceae), and the American clade of Urtica (Urticaceae). In the tropical Andes, these often grow together, especially in (naturally or anthropogenically) disturbed or secondary vegetation at middle to upper elevations. The climatic niches of the tropical groups studied here are relatively similar in temperature and temperature seasonality, but do differ in moisture seasonality. The Amotape–Huancabamba Zone (AHZ) between 3 and 8° S shows a clear diversity peak of overall species richness as well as for narrowly endemic species across the groups studied. For Nasa, we also show a particular diversity of growth forms in the AHZ. This can be interpreted as proxy for a high diversity of ecological niches based on high spatial habitat heterogeneity in this zone. Latitudinal ranges are generally larger toward the margins of overall range of the group. Species number and number of endemic species of our taxa peak at elevations of 2,500–3,500 m in the tropical Andes. Altitudinal diversity patterns correspond well with the altitudinal distribution of slope inclination. We hypothesize that the likelihood and frequency of landslides at steeper slopes translate into temporal habitat heterogeneity. The frequency of landslides may be causally connected to diversification especially for the numerous early colonizing taxa, such as Urtica and annual species of Nasa. In contrast to earlier hypotheses, uplift history is not reflected in the pattern here retrieved, since the AHZ is the area of the most recent Andean uplift. Similarly, a barrier effect of the low-lying Huancabamba depression is not retrieved in our data.},

	abstract = {Much effort has been made in recent years to define the timing and extent of Quaternary glaciation throughout the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen. These studies are challenging because of the logistical and political inaccessibility of the region, and the inherent problems associated with the application of numerical dating techniques. Nevertheless, the studies are providing abundant evidence for significant glacial advances throughout the last several glacial cycles and are beginning to accurately define the extent and timing of glaciation in selected regions. Studies are showing that Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers in arid regions during the last glacial cycle reached their maximum extent early in the cycle and that global Last Glacial Maximum glacier advances were significantly less extensive. However, along the more monsoonal-influenced Greater Himalaya, there is increasing evidence to suggest that glaciation was more extensive later in the last glacial cycle, but this has yet to be fully assessed. In addition, the new studies are showing that throughout most Himalayan–Tibetan regions, significant glacier advances occurred during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, with minor advances in some regions during the mid-Holocene. The still relatively poor chronological control in the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen, however, makes it difficult to construct correlations across the region, and with regions elsewhere in the world. This in turn makes it hard to assess the relative importance of the different climatic mechanisms that force glaciation across the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen, and to quantify paleoclimate change in this high altitude subtropical region. The Lateglacial and Holocene glacial records, however, are particularly well preserved in several Himalayan–Tibetan regions. Glacial successions such as these have the greatest potential to be examined in detail using newly developing numerical dating, and geomorphic and sedimentologic methods to derive high-resolution terrestrial records of glaciation that will help in paleoclimatic reconstruction for high altitude subtropical regions.},

Within the last decade two new techniques have promised to remedy this situation. These techniques, optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating, enable the age of many glacial features to be determined and have allowed us to study the extent and timing of Himalayan glaciation in the late Quaternary. New data show that the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred during the early part of the last glacial cycle, in most areas during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS-3). MIS-3 was a time of increased insolation, when the South Asian summer monsoon strengthened and penetrated further north into the Himalaya. The concomitant increased precipitation, occurring as snow at high altitudes, produced positive glacier mass balances, thereby allowing glaciers to advance. On the other hand, during the global LGM, ∼18–24 ka, Himalayan glaciation was very restricted in extent, generally extending \&lt;10 km from contemporary ice margins. Lower insolation at this time produced a weaker monsoon cycle, which in turn resulted in lower snowfall and snow accumulation at high altitudes. The modest advances that nevertheless did occur at this time are the result of reduced temperatures.},

	abstract = {Glacial geological evidence from throughout the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen is examined to determine the timing and extent of late Quaternary glaciation in this region and its relation to similar changes on a global scale. The evidence summarised here supports the existence of expanded ice caps and extensive valley glacier systems throughout the region during the late Quaternary. However, it cannot yet be determined whether the timing of the extent of maximum glaciation was synchronous throughout the entire region or whether the response was more varied. The lack of organic material needed for radiocarbon dating has hindered past progress in glacial reconstruction; however, application of optically stimulated luminescence and terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide methods has recently expanded the number of chronologies throughout the region. Limits to the precision and accuracy available with these methods and, more importantly, geological uncertainty imposed by processes of moraine formation and alteration both conspire to limit the time resolution on which correlations can be made to Milankovitch timescales (several ka). In order to put all studies on a common scale, well-dated sites have been re-evaluated and all the published terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide ages for moraine boulders and glacially eroded surfaces in the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen have been recalculated. Locally detailed studies indicate that there are considerable variations in the extent of glaciation from one region to the next during a glaciation. Glaciers throughout monsoon-influenced Tibet, the Himalaya and the Transhimalaya are likely synchronous both with climate change resulting from oscillations in the South Asian monsoon and with Northern Hemisphere cooling cycles. In contrast, glaciers in Pamir in the far western regions of the Himalayan–Tibet orogen advanced asynchronously relative to the other regions that are monsoon-influenced regions and appear to be mainly in phase with the Northern Hemisphere cooling cycles. Broad patterns of local and regional variability based on equilibrium-line altitudes have yet to be fully assessed, but have the potential to help define changes in climatic gradients over time.

	abstract = {Glaciers fed by monsoonal precipitation are mainly located on the Tibetan Plateau and easternmost Asia. These are characterized by simultaneous accumulation and ablation in summer season. The southeast part of the Tibetan Plateau experiences monsoonal precipitation in excess of 1000 mm/yr resulting in maritime temperate glaciers. In contrast, precipitation in the middle and northwest part of the Tibet Plateau decreases from 1000 to 200 mm/yr, resulting in the formation of continental cold glaciers. During the last glacial, the regions of heavy monsoonal precipitation were restricted to the southeast corner of the Plateau. The westerly weak precipitation zone shifted southward, and occupied the major northwest part of the Plateau, where the extreme continental type glaciers greatly expanded. In the eastern margin of Asia including Taiwan, Central Japan, Hokkaido and probably Mount Changbai, maritime type glaciers were more extensive because of higher monsoonal precipitation, especially heavy snowfall in northwest Japan owing to the rich moisture content of the winter monsoon over the Japan Sea.
The millennial scale monsoon intensity and glacial cycle in the Tibetan Plateau are strongly affected by the precession cycle and the orbit-inclination cycle which dominate the solar irradiance variation in low latitudes, as the high radiation and strong monsoon caused the warmer and wetter climate during 40–30 ka. The low radiation produced a weak monsoon and large depression of temperature and precipitation around 21 ka. This climatic pattern differs from that in the high latitudes where the eccentricity cycle is prominent.
The temperature during the last glacial maximum (LGM) was 6–9°C lower than today on the Tibetan Plateau and the equilibrium line altitude was depressed by about 1000 m in the southeast part, and in the east, south and west margins of the Plateau where precipitation was high. The equilibrium line depression was 500–300 m in the inner and especially the west part of the Plateau. This variation in equilibrium lines might be caused by the combined effect of the decrease in precipitation, the expansion of extreme continental glaciers and the active uplift of glaciated mountains. The estimation of a glaciated area of about 350,000 km2 in the Tibetan Plateau and roughly 500,000 km2 in High Asia based on observations of prominent features of LGM glacier extension, may be the direct evidence that shows there was no Quaternary unified ice sheet developed in the Tibetan Plateau.},

	abstract = {Aim  This study aimed to identify the ‘centres of endemism’ of the Chinese spermatophyte flora in order to indirectly detect the locations of past glacial refugia. The role of these areas as places for plant survival (‘plant museums’) and/or areas for plant evolution and speciation (‘plant cradles’) was also assessed. Location  China. Methods  Distribution patterns of 555 plant endemic taxa, taken as a representative sample of the Chinese endemic flora, were mapped on a 1° × 1° latitude/longitude grid. For each grid cell, species richness (total count of species) and weighted richness (down-weighting each species by the inverse of its range) were calculated. Grid cells within the top 5\% of highest values of weighted richness were considered centres of endemism. Based on available information, all plant taxa included in this study were classified into palaeoendemics and neoendemics, and their distributional patterns were represented separately. Results  Twenty areas of endemism were identified in central and southern China, roughly corresponding to mountain ranges, including the Hengduan and Daxue Mountains, the Yungui Plateau, central China Mountains, the Nanling Mountains, eastern China Mountains, and Hainan and Taiwan. Although almost all centres of endemism contained both palaeoendemic and neoendemic taxa, considerable differences in their respective numbers were recorded, with the majority of neoendemics on the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau (Hengduan Mountains sensu lato) but more palaeoendemics towards the east. Main conclusions  Owing to their varied topography, the mountainous regions of central and southern China have provided long-term stable habitats, which allowed palaeoendemics to persist and facilitated the process of speciation. Contrasting patterns between the palaeoendemics and neoendemics within refugia might be attributable to the geological and tectonic history of specific areas. The eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau clearly constitutes the ‘evolutionary front’ of China, probably as a result of the uninterrupted uplift of the plateau since the late Neogene. In contrast, the tectonic stability of central and southern China during the Tertiary may have facilitated the persistence of relict plant lineages.},

The juniper forests of the southern Tibetan Plateau, with one of the highest tree lines worldwide, are ideal for assessing the potential of high-mountain areas to harbor glacial refugia.
* • Genetic evidence for Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) endurance of these microrefugia is presented using paternally inherited chloroplast markers. Five-hundred and ninety individuals from 102 populations of the Juniperus tibetica complex were sequenced at three polymorphic chloroplast regions.

Of 62 haplotypes recovered, 40 were restricted to single populations. These private haplotypes and overall degrees of diversity were evenly spread among plateau and edge populations, strongly supporting the existence of LGM microrefugia throughout the present distribution range, partly well above 3500 m.
* • These results mark the highest LGM tree lines known, illustrating the potential significance of high-mountain areas for glacial refugia. Furthermore, as the close vicinity of orographic rear-edge and leading-edge populations potentially allows gene flow, surviving populations could preserve the complete spectrum of rear-edge and leading-edge adaptations.},

	abstract = {How Quaternary climatic oscillations affected range distributions and intraspecific divergence of alpine plants on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) remains largely unknown. Here, we report a survey of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA variation aimed at exploring the phylogeographical history of the QTP alpine endemic Aconitum gymnandrum. We sequenced three cpDNA fragments (rpl20-rps12 intergenic spacer, the trnV intron and psbA-trnH spacer) and also the nuclear (ITS) region in 245 individuals from 23 populations sampled throughout the species' range. Two distinct lineages, with eastern and western geographical distributions respectively, were identified from a phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequence variation. Based on a fast substitution rate, these were estimated to have diverged from each other in the early Pleistocene approximately 1.45 Ma. The analysis of cpDNA variation identified nine chlorotypes that clustered into two major clades that were broadly congruent in geographical distribution with the two ITS lineages. The east-west split of cpDNA divergence was supported by an amova which partitioned approximately half of the total variance between these two groups of populations. Analysis of the spatial distribution of chlorotypes showed that each clade was subdivided into two groups of populations such that a total of four population groups existed in the species. It is suggested that these different groups derive from four independent glacial refugia that existed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and that three of these refugia were located at high altitude on the QTP platform itself at that time. Coalescent simulation of chlorotype genealogies supported both an early Pleistocene origin of the two main cpDNA clades and also the `four-refugia' hypothesis during the LGM. Two previous phylogeographical studies of QTP alpine plants indicated that such plants retreated to refugia at the eastern/south-eastern plateau edge during the LGM and/or previous glacial maxima. However, the results for A. gymnandrum suggest that at least some of these cold-tolerant species may have also survived centrally on the QTP platform throughout the Quaternary.},

	abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is well known for being of great importance in the evolution of montane species due to its unique geological history and landform configuration, climate complexity, and diversified habitats. The effect of environmental changes since the Quaternary on species diversification, population genetic structure, and demography under environmental change can be studied using phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. Birds are the most well-studied group of all terrestrial vertebrates with regard to their response to climatic changes over time. Herein, we briefly review the species diversification of birds in response to the uplift of the QTP, focusing on summarizing the different phylogeographical patterns of birds on the Plateau, its southeastern margin, and the Eastern Himalayas and the reasons underlying these patterns. Speciation was found to be closely related to the uplift of the QTP, with different patterns of intraspecific processes: (1) no divergence within a single refuge was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area of the eastern margin of the Plateau; (2) two divergent lineages with separated refugia were located at the south-eastern and north-eastern margins of the plateau; and (3) multiple divergent lineages within subregions were found in the Eastern Himalayas. Glacial movements and induced climate change are considered to be key factors in shaping these different patterns. The species distributed mainly in the heavily ice-covered platform regions of the Plateau experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive glaciations, whereas the species distributed on the ice-free edges of the plateau maintained their population size at a stable level. Demographic stresses on the edge species might have been mitigated by the milder climate in comparison to their platform-distributed counterparts. Various behavioral and ecological characteristics, including dispersal capacity, habitat preference, and elevation specificity, along with evolutionary history might have helped to shape these different phylogeographical patterns.},

	abstract = {The relative importance of local ecological and larger-scale historical processes in causing differences in species richness across the globe remains keenly debated. To gain insight into these questions, we investigated the assembly of plant diversity in the Cerrado in South America, the world's most species-rich tropical savanna. Time-calibrated phylogenies suggest that Cerrado lineages started to diversify less than 10 Mya, with most lineages diversifying at 4 Mya or less, coinciding with the rise to dominance of flammable C4 grasses and expansion of the savanna biome worldwide. These plant phylogenies show that Cerrado lineages are strongly associated with adaptations to fire and have sister groups in largely fire-free nearby wet forest, seasonally dry forest, subtropical grassland, or wetland vegetation. These findings imply that the Cerrado formed in situ via recent and frequent adaptive shifts to resist fire, rather than via dispersal of lineages already adapted to fire. The location of the Cerrado surrounded by a diverse array of species-rich biomes, and the apparently modest adaptive barrier posed by fire, are likely to have contributed to its striking species richness. These findings add to growing evidence that the origins and historical assembly of species-rich biomes have been idiosyncratic, driven in large part by unique features of regional- and continental-scale geohistory and that different historical processes can lead to similar levels of modern species richness.},

At its southern and southeastern margins, it is flanked by the most significant hotspots of organismic diversity of the northern hemisphere (including birds), the Sino-Himalayan mountain forests. In contrast, the central plateau region itself harbours species-poor communities but also a good number of endemics that presumably evolved from rather ancient (pre-Pleistocene) phylogenetic lineage splits. We discuss the evolutionary history of QTP passerines from a twofold perspective including examples from our own research. First, we provide an overview of those alpine QTP endemics that represent late Miocene and Pliocene lineage splits, i.e. early colonisations to the central alpine QTP region. As an example, true rosefinches (genus Carpodacus) presumably evolved from a forested eastern QTP centre of origin and colonised the (semi-)open plateau habitats several times independently. Second, we discuss younger speciation events corresponding to phylogeographic east–west divides along the southern QTP margin. A multidisciplinary approach combining genetic, bioacoustic and morphological markers shed new light on the phylogenetic relationships of Pnoepyga wren babblers and on the intraspecific subdivision of the Buff-barred Warbler (Phylloscopus pulcher).},

	abstract = {The age of surface uplift in southeastern Tibet is currently unknown, but the initiation of major river incision can be used as a proxy for the timing of initial uplift. The topographically high eastern plateau and gently dipping southeastern plateau margin are mantled by an elevated, low-relief relict landscape that formed at a time of slow erosion at low elevation and low tectonic uplift rates prior to uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Thermochronology from deep river gorges that are cut into the relict landscape shows slow cooling between ca. 100 and ca. 10–20 Ma and a change to rapid cooling after ca. 13 Ma with initiation of rapid river incision at 0.25–0.5 mm/yr between 9 and 13 Ma. A rapid increase in mean elevation of eastern Tibet beginning at this time supports tectonic-climate models that correlate the lateral (eastern) expansion of high topography in Tibet with the late Miocene intensification of the Indian and east Asian monsoons.},

	abstract = {High topography in central Asia is perhaps the most fundamental expression of the Cenozoic Indo-Asian collision, yet an understanding of the timing and rates of development of the Tibetan Plateau remains elusive. Here we investigate the Cenozoic thermal histories of rocks along the eastern margin of the plateau adjacent to the Sichuan Basin in an effort to determine when the steep topographic escarpment that characterizes this margin developed. Temperature-time paths inferred from 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology of biotite, multiple diffusion domain modeling of alkali feldspar 40Ar release spectra, and (U-Th)/He thermochronology of zircon and apatite imply that rocks at the present-day topographic front of the plateau underwent slow cooling ({\textless}1°C/m.y.) from Jurassic times until the late Miocene or early Pliocene. The regional extent and consistency of thermal histories during this time period suggest the presence of a stable thermal structure and imply that regional denudation rates were low ({\textless}0.1 mm/yr for nominal continental geotherms). Beginning in the late Miocene or early Pliocene, these samples experienced a pronounced cooling event ({\textgreater}30°–50°C/m.y.) coincident with exhumation from inferred depths of ∼8–10 km, at denudation rates of 1–2 mm/yr. Samples from the interior of the plateau continued to cool relatively slowly during the same time period (∼3°C/m.y.), suggesting limited exhumation (1–2 km). However, these samples record a slight increase in cooling rate (from {\textless}1 to ∼3°C/m.y.) at some time during the middle Tertiary; the tectonic significance of this change remains uncertain. Regardless, late Cenozoic denudation in this region appears to have been markedly heterogeneous, with the highest rates of exhumation focused at the topographic front of the plateau margin. We infer that the onset of rapid cooling at the plateau margin reflects the erosional response to the development of regionally significant topographic gradients between the plateau and the stable Sichuan Basin and thus marks the onset of deformation related to the development of the Tibetan Plateau in this region. The present margin of the plateau adjacent to and north of the Sichuan Basin is apparently no older than the late Miocene or early Pliocene (∼5–12 Ma).},

	abstract = {True rosefinches (Aves: Carpodacus) are restricted to Eurasia, and 19 out of 25 species occur in the Sino-Himalayas, making this the likely centre of origin. To test this hypothesis, suggested species splits had to be evaluated and potential further cryptic diversity unravelled. A taxon-complete dated molecular phylogeny was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. Maximum-parsimony and likelihood approaches were applied to deduce ancestral areas. Rosefinches, including the widespread Carpodacus erythrinus (Pallas, 1770), originated in south-west China (and the Himalayas) 14 Mya, and gave rise to a smaller clade consisting of C. erythrinus, Haematospiza sipahi (Hodgson, 1836), and Chaunoproctus ferreorostris (Vigors, 1829), and a larger clade with 22 species. The latter split into four major lineages through vicariance during the uplift of the Himalayas. The suggested species splits of dubius from Carpodacus thura Bonaparte \& Schlegel, 1850, formosanus from Carpodacus vinaceus Verreaux, 1871, grandis from Carpodacus rhodochlamys Brandt, 1843, verreauxii from Carpodacus rodopeplus (Vigors, 1831) (even polyphyletic) could be supported, whereas the suggested split of severtzovi from Carpodacus rubicilla (Güldenstädt, 1775) appears to be too young, and should be considered intraspecific. On the other hand, the central Asian lineage of Carpodacus synoicus Temminck, 1825 deserves species rank [Carpodacus stolickae (Hume, 1874)]. The Carpodacus eos/pulcherrimus complex consists of four lineages, pulcherrimus/argyrophrys and davidianus [Carpodacus pulcherrimus s.s. (Moore, 1856)], and eos and waltoni [Carpodacus waltoni (Sharpe, 1905)]. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London},

	abstract = {We analyzed passerine biodiversity and phylogeography in the Sino-Himalayan region with respect to neighboring areas, especially the Siberian taiga zone to the north and tropical Asia southeast of the Himalayas and mountainous parts of southwest China. Fresh results, informative about evolutionary processes in that area, were obtained mainly by the application of new methods in passerine systematics, acoustic and molecular genetic markers. It became evident that species with areas in the Himalayas and southwest China and, in addition, often with disjunct areas in Siberia, actually belong to swarms of closely related, mostly allopatric species. In many cases these differ markedly in vocalizations and are deeply split according to molecular genetic markers. External morphology of the constituent taxa quite often remained surprisingly homogeneous and thus resulted in traditional subspecies status of single populations at best. Other such well-differentiated taxa were often overlooked and only discovered by molecular genetic techniques. Within the Himalayas, contrary to current thinking, intra-range differentiation is well developed in some taxa but still largely unresolved because of deficient sampling along the Himalayan chain. Both subspecies and allopatric species are also concerned here. Apparently, the Himalayas were mostly settled from the east following intra-range diversification. Immigration from the west into the Himalayas was a much rarer event and, impeded by the monsoons, immigrants reached just west Nepal and, with respect to evolutionary history, did not diverge further. Himalayan endemic passerines are few and mainly confined to the western part.},

	abstract = {The California Floristic Province exhibits one of the richest floras on the planet, with more than 5500 native plant species, approximately 40\% of which are endemic. Despite its impressive diversity and the attention it has garnered from ecologists and evolutionary biologists, historical causes of species richness and endemism in California remain poorly understood. Using a phylogenetic analysis of 16 angiosperm clades, each containing California natives in addition to species found only outside California, we show that CA's current biodiversity primarily results from low extinction rates, as opposed to elevated speciation or immigration rates. Speciation rates in California were lowest among Arcto-Tertiary lineages (i.e., those colonizing California from the north, during the Tertiary), but extinction rates were universally low across California native plants of all historical, geographic origins. In contrast to long-accepted ideas, we find that California diversification rates were generally unaffected by the onset of the Mediterranean climate. However, the Mediterranean climate coincided with immigration of many desert species, validating one previous hypothesis regarding origins of CA's plant diversity. This study implicates topographic complexity and climatic buffering as key, long-standing features of CA's landscape favoring plant species persistence and diversification, and highlights California as an important refuge under changing climates.},

	abstract = {The Karakoram terrane in Northern Pakistan is geologically equivalent to the Qiangtang terrane of central Tibet but unlike Tibet shows extreme topographic relief, high uplift-exhumation and erosion rates and exposes deep crustal metamorphic and igneous rocks of the lower crust. The Karakoram terrane has been above sea-level since Early to Mid-Cretaceous, the age of the youngest marine sedimentary rocks. During the Late Jurassic to Mid-Cretaceous north-dipping subduction of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere beneath the Karakoram resulted in widespread Andean I-type granite-granodiorite magmatism (Hunza, Hushe plutonic units) with possible concomitant low-pressure andalusite-sillimanite grade Buchan-type metamorphism. The Kohistan intra-oceanic island arc developed above a second north-dipping subduction zone to the south during the Aptian-Eocene (∼120–45 Ma) and was accreted to the southern margin of Asia concomitantly with obduction onto India during the Late Cretaceous. Final closure of Neo-Tethys and collision of India with Asia occurred at ca. 50 Ma. Continuous crustal thickening occurred across the southern Karakoram resulting in widespread regional Barrovian facies kyanite- and sillimanite-grade metamorphism with U-Pb zircon and monazite ages ranging from Latest Cretaceous (∼63 Ma) to Pliocene times (4-3 Ma). Crustal melting resulted in intrusion of several sets of leucogranite dykes (Hunza dykes) at ∼50 Ma and 35 Ma. The major phase of crustal melting in the Baltoro plutonic unit spanned at least 13 million years from 26-13 Ma (Late Oligocene to Mid-Miocene), and resulted in intrusion of a large-scale biotite monzogranite to garnet two-mica leucogranite intrusion of batholithic proportion. Some extra heat contribution from the upper mantle may have been required to account for the large size of the granite batholith and the lamprophyric dykes intruded around the margins. The youngest metamorphism and partial melting is known from the deep crustal metamorphic-migmatite gneiss domes (Dassu dome) of Pliocene age in the Baltoro region and the Late Miocene Sumayar leucogranite in Hunza. Geological and U-Pb geochronological data show that the Karakoram Range was a dynamic active mountain range with semi-continuous crustal thickening, deformation, metamorphism and partial melting for at least the last 63 million years and continues to this day.},

                  unique biotas are poorly understood. In varying
                  degrees, local and regional extinction,
                  long-distance colonization, and local recruitment
                  may all contribute to the exceptional character of
                  these communities. Also, it is debated whether
                  mountain endemics mostly originate from local
                  lowland taxa, or from lineages that reach the
                  mountain by long-range dispersal from cool

                  pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local

  abstract     = {Premise of research. Chamaecrista sect. Chamaecrista
                  ser. Coriaceae comprises 22 species, mostly
                  distributed in the highlands of Brazil in Cerrado
                  (Neotropical savanna) and Campo Rupestre (upland
                  rocky field) vegetation. Phylogenetic studies for
                  plant taxa of these rich and endemic Brazilian
                  floras are still scarce. In this context, the main
                  objective of our study was to examine the
                  phylogenetic history of a plant group diversified in
                  the mountainous areas of central
                  Brazil.Methodology. The phylogeny of Chamaecrista
                  ser. Coriaceae was examined with combined data from
                  two nuclear regions (ETS [external transcribed
                  spacer] and ITS), two plastid regions (trnD-T and
                  trnL-F), and morphological evidence from
                  comprehensive sampling of the series. We used
                  phylogenetic analyses to evaluate
                  morphological-character evolution to identify
                  putative synapomorphies, and we used Bayesian
                  estimation to explore the timing of diversification
                  of the group.Pivotal results. The series, as
                  currently circumscribed, appears as polyphyletic in
                  all of the analyses, but most of the species
                  ascribed to it form a well-supported clade endemic
                  to highland areas in the Brazilian Cerrado, referred
                  to as the Coriaceae clade. The plastid regions
                  provided high support for the monophyly of this
                  clade, with the nuclear regions providing better
                  resolution within the clade. In addition to
                  molecular evidence, two putative morphological
                  synapomorphies were found. The age-estimation
                  analyses show a recent diversification in the
                  group.Conclusions. Molecular and morphological data
                  indicated that a narrower definition of Chamaecrista
                  ser. Coriaceae as a monophyletic group is
                  required. In addition to two clear deletions in the
                  plastid sequences studied, the presence of a woody
                  underground system and flowers with one stamen
                  displaced to the same side as the gynoecium appear
                  as putative morphological synapomorphies. The low
                  resolution found among species within the clade may
                  reflect a recent radiation that has occurred in the
                  past 5 Myr—a common pattern in other groups
                  restricted to highland areas in South America.},

                  Cenozoic, or about the underlying drivers of
                  diversification. There have been few attempts to
                  estimate net species diversification rates or
                  underlying speciation and extinction rates for
                  legume clades, to test whether among-lineage

                  diversification rate shifts on specific branches of
                  the legume phylogenetic tree. In this study,
                  time-calibrated phylogenetic trees for a set of
                  species-rich legume clades – Calliandra,
                  Indigofereae, Lupinus, Mimosa and Robinieae – and
                  for the legume family as a whole, are used to
                  explore how we might approach these questions. These
                  clades are analysed using recently developed maximum
                  likelihood and Bayesian methods to detect species
                  diversification rate shifts and test for
                  among-lineage variation in speciation, extinction
                  and net diversification rates. Possible explanations
                  for rate shifts in terms of extrinsic factors and/or

                  habitats (5–2 million year ago (mya)) and floristic
                  diversity has polarized hypotheses on the evolution

                  biodiversity hotspot. Most research and conservation
                  attention in the Andes has focused on biomes such as
                  rain forest, cloud forest, and páramo, where much
                  plant species diversity is the hypothesized result
                  of rapid speciation associated with the recent
                  Andean orogeny. In contrast to these mesic biomes,
                  we present evidence for a different, older
                  diversification history in seasonally dry tropical
                  forests (SDTF) occupying rain-shadowed inter-Andean
                  valleys. High DNA sequence divergence in
                  Cyathostegia mathewsii, a shrub endemic to
                  inter-Andean SDTF, indicates isolation for at least
                  5 million years of populations separated by only
                  ca. 600 km of high cordillera in Peru. In
                  conjunction with fossil evidence indicating the
                  presence of SDTF in the Andes in the late Miocene,
                  our data suggest that the disjunct small valley
                  pockets of inter-Andean SDTF have persisted over
                  millions of years. These forests are rich in endemic
                  species but massively impacted, and merit better

                  270 270 References 270 Summary We review the
                  empirical phylogenetic literature on plant
                  diversification, highlighting challenges in
                  separating the effects of speciation and extinction,
                  in specifying diversification mechanisms, and in
                  making convincing arguments. In recent discussions
                  of context dependence, key opportunities and
                  landscapes, and indirect effects and lag times, we
                  see a distinct shift away from
                  single-point/single-cause ‘key innovation’
                  hypotheses toward more nuanced explanations
                  involving multiple interacting causal agents
                  assembled step-wise through a tree. To help
                  crystalize this emerging perspective we introduce
                  the term ‘synnovation’ (a hybrid of ‘synergy’ and
                  ‘innovation’) for an interacting combination of
                  traits with a particular consequence (‘key
                  synnovation’ in the case of increased
                  diversification rate), and the term ‘confluence’ for
                  the sequential coming together of a set of traits
                  (innovations and synnovations), environmental
                  changes, and geographic movements along the branches
                  of a phylogenetic tree. We illustrate these concepts
                  using the radiation of Bromeliaceae. We also
                  highlight the generality of these ideas by
                  considering how rate heterogeneity associated with a
                  confluence relates to the existence of particularly
                  species-poor lineages, or ‘depauperons.’ Many
                  challenges are posed by this re-purposed research
                  framework, including difficulties associated with
                  partial taxon sampling, uncertainty in divergence
                  time estimation, and extinction.},

                  includes c. 4426 species ranging from sea level to
                  {\textgreater} 5000 m. We predict that the
                  interaction of low specific leaf area (SLA) and
                  montane habitats is correlated with increased
                  diversification rates.  * A molecular phylogeny of
                  Ericaceae based on rbcL and matK sequence data was
                  built and dated with 18 fossil calibrations and
                  divergence time estimates. We identified radiations
                  using bamm and correlates of diversification rate
                  changes using binary-state speciation and extinction
                  (BiSSE) and multiple-state speciation and extinction
                  (MuSSE) analyses.  * Analyses revealed six largely
                  montane radiations. Lineages in mountains
                  diversified faster than nonmountain lineages (higher
                  speciation rate, but no difference in extinction
                  rate), and lineages with low SLA diversified faster
                  than high-SLA lineages. Further, habitat and trait
                  had a positive interactive effect on
                  diversification.  * Our results suggest that the
                  species richness in mountains is the result of
                  increased speciation rather than reduced extinction
                  or increased immigration. Increased speciation in
                  Ericaceae was facilitated by low SLA.},

  abstract     = {* Recent developments in phylogenetic methods have
                  made it possible to reconstruct evolutionary
                  radiations from extant taxa, but identifying the
                  triggers of radiations is still problematic. Here,
                  we propose a conceptual framework to explore the
                  role of variables that may impact radiations. We
                  classify the variables into extrinsic conditions vs
                  intrinsic traits, whether they provide background
                  conditions, trigger the radiation, or modulate the
                  radiation.  * We used three clades representing
                  angiosperm phylogenetic and structural diversity
                  (Ericaceae, Fagales and Poales) as test groups. We
                  located radiation events, selected variables
                  potentially associated with diversification, and
                  inferred the temporal sequences of evolution.  * We
                  found 13 shifts in diversification regimes in the
                  three clades. We classified the associated
                  variables, and determined whether they originated
                  before the relevant radiation (backgrounds),
                  originated simultaneously with the radiations
                  (triggers), or evolved later (modulators).  * By
                  applying this conceptual framework, we establish
                  that radiations require both extrinsic conditions
                  and intrinsic traits, but that the sequence of these
                  is not important. We also show that diversification
                  drivers can be detected by being more variable
                  within a radiation than conserved traits that only
                  allow occupation of a new habitat. This framework
                  facilitates exploration of the causative factors of
                  evolutionary radiations.},

                  (BAMM) has recently taken the study of lineage
                  diversification by storm. BAMM estimates the
                  diversification-rate parameters (speciation and
                  extinction) for every branch of a study phylogeny
                  and infers the number and location of
                  diversification-rate shifts across branches of a
                  tree. Our evaluation of BAMM reveals two major
                  theoretical errors: (i) the likelihood function
                  (which estimates the model parameters from the data)
                  is incorrect, and (ii) the compound Poisson process
                  prior model (which describes the prior distribution
                  of diversification-rate shifts across branches) is
                  incoherent. Using simulation, we demonstrate that
                  these theoretical issues cause statistical
                  pathologies; posterior estimates of the number of
                  diversification-rate shifts are strongly influenced
                  by the assumed prior, and estimates of
                  diversification-rate parameters are
                  unreliable. Moreover, the inability to correctly
                  compute the likelihood or to correctly specify the
                  prior for rate-variable trees precludes the use of
                  Bayesian approaches for testing hypotheses regarding
                  the number and location of diversification-rate
                  shifts using BAMM.},
