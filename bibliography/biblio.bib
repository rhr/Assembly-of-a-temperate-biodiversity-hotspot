  pages = {311-322},
  abstract = {Background and Aims It is an enduring question as to the mechanisms leading to the high diversity and the processes producing endemics with unusual morphologies in the Himalayan alpine region. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships and origins of three such endemic genera were analysed, Dolomiaea, Diplazoptilon and Xanthopappus, all in the tribe Cardueae of Asteraceae.Methods The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnL-F and psbA-trnH regions of these three genera were sequenced. The same regions for other related genera in Cardueae were also sequenced or downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from individual and combined data sets of the three types of sequences using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.Key Results The phylogenetic tree obtained allowed earlier hypotheses concerning the relationships of these three endemic genera based on gross morphology to be rejected. Frolovia and Saussurea costus were deeply nested within Dolomiaea, and the strong statistical support for the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade suggested that circumscription of Dolomiaea should be more broadly redefined. Diplazoptilon was resolved as sister to Himalaiella, and these two together are sister to Lipschitziella. The clade comprising these three genera is sister to Jurinea, and together these four genera are sister to the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade. Xanthopappus, previously hypothesized to be closely related to Carduus, was found to be nested within a well-supported but not fully resolved Onopordum group with Alfredia, Ancathia, Lamyropappus, Olgaea, Synurus and Syreitschikovia, rather than the Carduus group. The crude dating based on ITS sequence divergence revealed that the divergence time of Dolomiaea–Frolovia from its sister group probably occurred 13·6–12·2 million years ago (Ma), and the divergence times of the other two genera, Xanthopappus and Diplazoptilon, from their close relatives around 5·7–4·7 Ma and 2·0–1·6 Ma, respectively.Conclusions The findings provide an improved understanding of the intergeneric relationships in Cardueae. The crude calibration of lineages indicates that the uplifts of the Qiinghai–Tibetan Plateau since the Miocene might have served as a continuous stimulus for the production of these morphologically aberrant endemic elements of the Himalayan flora.},

  journal = {Earth-Science Reviews},
  volume = {112},
  number = {3–4},
  pages = {155-172},
  abstract = {Debate continues over whether global cooling or uplift of the Tibetan Plateau provided the first-order driver for the aridification (moisture levels) of Central Asia throughout the Mid–Late Miocene, between about 17 and 5 Ma. This review attempts to throw new light on the relations between the aridification and these two key factors. This paper examines the evolution of Miocene climate (both moisture and temperature) within five separate regions of Eurasia to help understand the large scale controls of long-term moisture in Central Asia. The five regions include: (1) Europe, (2) high-latitude Asia, (3) the East Asian Monsoon region, (4) the South Asian Monsoon region, and (5) Central Asia itself, because moisture reaching Central Asia has to firstly cross at least one of the other four regions. Temperature proxy data compiled from these five regions correlate with ocean temperatures from the global deep-sea oxygen isotope records. Furthermore, compiled moisture proxy data from the four regions surrounding Central Asia co-vary and correlate with each other. This can be explained by positive feedbacks between drying and cooling, and supports the assumption that global cooling provides a dominant driving factor for the drying of Eurasia: global cooling reduces the amount of water vapor held in the atmosphere and thereby can cause terrestrial drying. However, in Central Asia the moisture evolution shows less similarity with its surroundings. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (including the Tianshan Mountains) could provide a possible explanation for this difference. The changing topography resulting from uplift events over time and space strongly influenced the moisture patterns in Central Asia during Miocene times. Future research on the spatial timing and amplitude of Tibetan Plateau uplift should be useful to understand the moisture processes in Central Asia during the Miocene.},

  abstract = {The Hengduan Mountains (H-D Mountains) in China flank the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (Q–T Plateau) and are a center of great temperate plant diversity. The geological history and complex topography of these mountains may have prompted the in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One hypothesis is that the Q–T Plateau underwent a final, rapid phase of uplift 8–7 million years ago (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a separate event occurring 4–3 Mya. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic, biogeographic, divergence time dating, and diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The Lilium–Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q–T Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence between the two gene trees which may result from hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major lineages within Lilium–Nomocharis may be temporally coincident with Q–T Plateau uplift occurring 8–7 Mya and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4–3 Mya. Our analyses of diversification times and rates among Lilium–Nomocharis clades are less conclusive. However, these do suggest high extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.},
