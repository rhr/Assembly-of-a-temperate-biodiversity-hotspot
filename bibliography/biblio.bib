  pages = {311-322},
  abstract = {Background and Aims It is an enduring question as to the mechanisms leading to the high diversity and the processes producing endemics with unusual morphologies in the Himalayan alpine region. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships and origins of three such endemic genera were analysed, Dolomiaea, Diplazoptilon and Xanthopappus, all in the tribe Cardueae of Asteraceae.Methods The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnL-F and psbA-trnH regions of these three genera were sequenced. The same regions for other related genera in Cardueae were also sequenced or downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from individual and combined data sets of the three types of sequences using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.Key Results The phylogenetic tree obtained allowed earlier hypotheses concerning the relationships of these three endemic genera based on gross morphology to be rejected. Frolovia and Saussurea costus were deeply nested within Dolomiaea, and the strong statistical support for the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade suggested that circumscription of Dolomiaea should be more broadly redefined. Diplazoptilon was resolved as sister to Himalaiella, and these two together are sister to Lipschitziella. The clade comprising these three genera is sister to Jurinea, and together these four genera are sister to the Dolomiaea–Frolovia clade. Xanthopappus, previously hypothesized to be closely related to Carduus, was found to be nested within a well-supported but not fully resolved Onopordum group with Alfredia, Ancathia, Lamyropappus, Olgaea, Synurus and Syreitschikovia, rather than the Carduus group. The crude dating based on ITS sequence divergence revealed that the divergence time of Dolomiaea–Frolovia from its sister group probably occurred 13·6–12·2 million years ago (Ma), and the divergence times of the other two genera, Xanthopappus and Diplazoptilon, from their close relatives around 5·7–4·7 Ma and 2·0–1·6 Ma, respectively.Conclusions The findings provide an improved understanding of the intergeneric relationships in Cardueae. The crude calibration of lineages indicates that the uplifts of the Qiinghai–Tibetan Plateau since the Miocene might have served as a continuous stimulus for the production of these morphologically aberrant endemic elements of the Himalayan flora.},

  journal = {Earth-Science Reviews},
  volume = {112},
  number = {3–4},
  pages = {155-172},
  abstract = {Debate continues over whether global cooling or uplift of the Tibetan Plateau provided the first-order driver for the aridification (moisture levels) of Central Asia throughout the Mid–Late Miocene, between about 17 and 5 Ma. This review attempts to throw new light on the relations between the aridification and these two key factors. This paper examines the evolution of Miocene climate (both moisture and temperature) within five separate regions of Eurasia to help understand the large scale controls of long-term moisture in Central Asia. The five regions include: (1) Europe, (2) high-latitude Asia, (3) the East Asian Monsoon region, (4) the South Asian Monsoon region, and (5) Central Asia itself, because moisture reaching Central Asia has to firstly cross at least one of the other four regions. Temperature proxy data compiled from these five regions correlate with ocean temperatures from the global deep-sea oxygen isotope records. Furthermore, compiled moisture proxy data from the four regions surrounding Central Asia co-vary and correlate with each other. This can be explained by positive feedbacks between drying and cooling, and supports the assumption that global cooling provides a dominant driving factor for the drying of Eurasia: global cooling reduces the amount of water vapor held in the atmosphere and thereby can cause terrestrial drying. However, in Central Asia the moisture evolution shows less similarity with its surroundings. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (including the Tianshan Mountains) could provide a possible explanation for this difference. The changing topography resulting from uplift events over time and space strongly influenced the moisture patterns in Central Asia during Miocene times. Future research on the spatial timing and amplitude of Tibetan Plateau uplift should be useful to understand the moisture processes in Central Asia during the Miocene.},

  abstract = {The Hengduan Mountains (H-D Mountains) in China flank the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (Q–T Plateau) and are a center of great temperate plant diversity. The geological history and complex topography of these mountains may have prompted the in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One hypothesis is that the Q–T Plateau underwent a final, rapid phase of uplift 8–7 million years ago (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a separate event occurring 4–3 Mya. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic, biogeographic, divergence time dating, and diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The Lilium–Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q–T Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence between the two gene trees which may result from hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major lineages within Lilium–Nomocharis may be temporally coincident with Q–T Plateau uplift occurring 8–7 Mya and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4–3 Mya. Our analyses of diversification times and rates among Lilium–Nomocharis clades are less conclusive. However, these do suggest high extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.},

To orient this line of research we develop a conceptual framework in which the likelihood of a biome shift is a function of (a) exposure to contrasting environments over time, (b) the evolutionary accessibility of relevant adaptations, and (c) changing biotic interactions. We evaluate the literature on biome shifts in plants in relation to a set of hypotheses on the size, connectedness, and absolute age of biomes, as well as on the adaptability of particular lineages and ecological interactions over time. We also critique the phylogenetic inference of past biomes and a “global” model-based approach to biome evolution. More robust generalizations about biome shifts will require detailed studies of well-sampled and well-resolved clades, accounting for changes in the relevant abiotic and biotic factors through time.},

	abstract = {Aim: Montane regions like the Sino-Himalayas constitute global diversity hotspots. Various mechanisms such as in situ adaptive divergence, speciation following immigration or allopatric diversification in complex landscapes have been proposed to account for the exceptional diversity found in a particular clade in a montane setting. We investigated macroevolutionary patterns to test these different hypotheses in the continental radiation of a Sino-Himalayan bird group, the parrotbills (Paradoxornithidae). Location: Sino-Himalayan region, Indo-Burma. Methods: We used phylogenetic comparative methods based on a multilocus, time-calibrated phylogeny to reconstruct patterns of lineage diversification, biogeographical history, morphological evolution as well as of climate niche history using ecological niche modelling. Results: The radiation of parrotbills started c. 12 Ma, diversifying at an apparent constant rate over time. The biogeographical history appears to be complex, within-region speciation in mountains was restricted to China. Size evolution was concentrated in the early phase of parrotbill radiation, whereas morphological shape evolution did not differ from Brownian motion. We found no indication for niche conservatism, with climate niche evolution occurring throughout the radiation of parrotbills. Conclusions: Parrotbills diversified within a time span of increased regional orogenesis and associated strong climate change. While the south-west and central Chinese mountains were revealed to be a species pump, with in situ allopatric diversification triggered by complex topography and high habitat turnover, the diversity in the Himalayas was chiefly the result of immigration. Evidence for continuous ecological specialization and for the absence of climate niche conservatism could be interpreted as the consequence of ongoing climate- and habitat-induced ecological opportunities. The radiation of parrotbills demonstrates the influence of multiple drivers of diversification in a single group due to the dynamic geological and palaeoclimatic history of the Sino-Himalayan region and illustrates the complex nature of continental radiations.},

	abstract = {Andean orogeny is considered as one of the most important events for the development of current plant diversity in South America. We compare available phylogenetic studies and divergence time estimates for plant lineages that may have diversified in response to Andean orogeny. The influence of the Andes on plant diversification is separated into four major groups: The Andes as source of new high-elevation habitats, as a vicariant barrier, as a North-South corridor, and as generator of new environmental conditions outside the Andes. Biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other regions are also considered. Divergence time estimates indicate that high-elevation lineages originated and diversified during or after the major phases of Andean uplift (Mid-Miocene to Pliocene), although there are some exceptions. As expected, Andean mid-elevation lineages tend to be older than high-elevation groups. Most clades with disjunct distribution on both sides of the Andes diverged during Andean uplift. Inner-Andean clades also tend to have divergence time during or after Andean uplift. This is interpreted as evidence of vicariance. Dispersal along the Andes has been shown to occur in either direction, mostly dated after the Andean uplift. Divergence time estimates of plant groups outside the Andes encompass a wider range of ages, indicating that the Andes may not be necessarily the cause of these diversifications. The Andes are biogeographically related to all neighboring areas, especially Central America, with floristic interchanges in both directions since Early Miocene times. Direct biogeographical relationships between the Andes and other disjunct regions have also been shown in phylogenetic studies, especially with the eastern Brazilian highlands and North America. The history of the Andean flora is complex and plant diversification has been driven by a variety of processes, including environmental change, adaptation, and biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {The tropical Andes are a hotspot of biodiversity, but detailed altitudinal and latitudinal distribution patterns of species are poorly understood. We compare the distribution and diversity patterns of four Andean plant groups on the basis of georeferenced specimen data: the genus Nasa (Loasaceae), the two South American sections of Ribes (sect. Parilla and sect. Andina, Grossulariaceae), and the American clade of Urtica (Urticaceae). In the tropical Andes, these often grow together, especially in (naturally or anthropogenically) disturbed or secondary vegetation at middle to upper elevations. The climatic niches of the tropical groups studied here are relatively similar in temperature and temperature seasonality, but do differ in moisture seasonality. The Amotape–Huancabamba Zone (AHZ) between 3 and 8° S shows a clear diversity peak of overall species richness as well as for narrowly endemic species across the groups studied. For Nasa, we also show a particular diversity of growth forms in the AHZ. This can be interpreted as proxy for a high diversity of ecological niches based on high spatial habitat heterogeneity in this zone. Latitudinal ranges are generally larger toward the margins of overall range of the group. Species number and number of endemic species of our taxa peak at elevations of 2,500–3,500 m in the tropical Andes. Altitudinal diversity patterns correspond well with the altitudinal distribution of slope inclination. We hypothesize that the likelihood and frequency of landslides at steeper slopes translate into temporal habitat heterogeneity. The frequency of landslides may be causally connected to diversification especially for the numerous early colonizing taxa, such as Urtica and annual species of Nasa. In contrast to earlier hypotheses, uplift history is not reflected in the pattern here retrieved, since the AHZ is the area of the most recent Andean uplift. Similarly, a barrier effect of the low-lying Huancabamba depression is not retrieved in our data.},

	abstract = {Much effort has been made in recent years to define the timing and extent of Quaternary glaciation throughout the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen. These studies are challenging because of the logistical and political inaccessibility of the region, and the inherent problems associated with the application of numerical dating techniques. Nevertheless, the studies are providing abundant evidence for significant glacial advances throughout the last several glacial cycles and are beginning to accurately define the extent and timing of glaciation in selected regions. Studies are showing that Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers in arid regions during the last glacial cycle reached their maximum extent early in the cycle and that global Last Glacial Maximum glacier advances were significantly less extensive. However, along the more monsoonal-influenced Greater Himalaya, there is increasing evidence to suggest that glaciation was more extensive later in the last glacial cycle, but this has yet to be fully assessed. In addition, the new studies are showing that throughout most Himalayan–Tibetan regions, significant glacier advances occurred during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, with minor advances in some regions during the mid-Holocene. The still relatively poor chronological control in the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen, however, makes it difficult to construct correlations across the region, and with regions elsewhere in the world. This in turn makes it hard to assess the relative importance of the different climatic mechanisms that force glaciation across the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen, and to quantify paleoclimate change in this high altitude subtropical region. The Lateglacial and Holocene glacial records, however, are particularly well preserved in several Himalayan–Tibetan regions. Glacial successions such as these have the greatest potential to be examined in detail using newly developing numerical dating, and geomorphic and sedimentologic methods to derive high-resolution terrestrial records of glaciation that will help in paleoclimatic reconstruction for high altitude subtropical regions.},

Within the last decade two new techniques have promised to remedy this situation. These techniques, optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating, enable the age of many glacial features to be determined and have allowed us to study the extent and timing of Himalayan glaciation in the late Quaternary. New data show that the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred during the early part of the last glacial cycle, in most areas during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS-3). MIS-3 was a time of increased insolation, when the South Asian summer monsoon strengthened and penetrated further north into the Himalaya. The concomitant increased precipitation, occurring as snow at high altitudes, produced positive glacier mass balances, thereby allowing glaciers to advance. On the other hand, during the global LGM, ∼18–24 ka, Himalayan glaciation was very restricted in extent, generally extending \&lt;10 km from contemporary ice margins. Lower insolation at this time produced a weaker monsoon cycle, which in turn resulted in lower snowfall and snow accumulation at high altitudes. The modest advances that nevertheless did occur at this time are the result of reduced temperatures.},

	abstract = {Glacial geological evidence from throughout the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen is examined to determine the timing and extent of late Quaternary glaciation in this region and its relation to similar changes on a global scale. The evidence summarised here supports the existence of expanded ice caps and extensive valley glacier systems throughout the region during the late Quaternary. However, it cannot yet be determined whether the timing of the extent of maximum glaciation was synchronous throughout the entire region or whether the response was more varied. The lack of organic material needed for radiocarbon dating has hindered past progress in glacial reconstruction; however, application of optically stimulated luminescence and terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide methods has recently expanded the number of chronologies throughout the region. Limits to the precision and accuracy available with these methods and, more importantly, geological uncertainty imposed by processes of moraine formation and alteration both conspire to limit the time resolution on which correlations can be made to Milankovitch timescales (several ka). In order to put all studies on a common scale, well-dated sites have been re-evaluated and all the published terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide ages for moraine boulders and glacially eroded surfaces in the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen have been recalculated. Locally detailed studies indicate that there are considerable variations in the extent of glaciation from one region to the next during a glaciation. Glaciers throughout monsoon-influenced Tibet, the Himalaya and the Transhimalaya are likely synchronous both with climate change resulting from oscillations in the South Asian monsoon and with Northern Hemisphere cooling cycles. In contrast, glaciers in Pamir in the far western regions of the Himalayan–Tibet orogen advanced asynchronously relative to the other regions that are monsoon-influenced regions and appear to be mainly in phase with the Northern Hemisphere cooling cycles. Broad patterns of local and regional variability based on equilibrium-line altitudes have yet to be fully assessed, but have the potential to help define changes in climatic gradients over time.

The westerly weak precipitation zone shifted southward, and occupied the major northwest part of the Plateau, where the extreme continental type glaciers greatly expanded. In the eastern margin of Asia including Taiwan, Central Japan, Hokkaido and probably Mount Changbai, maritime type glaciers were more extensive because of higher monsoonal precipitation, especially heavy snowfall in northwest Japan owing to the rich moisture content of the winter monsoon over the Japan Sea.
The millennial scale monsoon intensity and glacial cycle in the Tibetan Plateau are strongly affected by the precession cycle and the orbit-inclination cycle which dominate the solar irradiance variation in low latitudes, as the high radiation and strong monsoon caused the warmer and wetter climate during 40–30 ka. The low radiation produced a weak monsoon and large depression of temperature and precipitation around 21 ka. This climatic pattern differs from that in the high latitudes where the eccentricity cycle is prominent.
The temperature during the last glacial maximum (LGM) was 6–9°C lower than today on the Tibetan Plateau and the equilibrium line altitude was depressed by about 1000 m in the southeast part, and in the east, south and west margins of the Plateau where precipitation was high. The equilibrium line depression was 500–300 m in the inner and especially the west part of the Plateau. This variation in equilibrium lines might be caused by the combined effect of the decrease in precipitation, the expansion of extreme continental glaciers and the active uplift of glaciated mountains. The estimation of a glaciated area of about 350,000 km2 in the Tibetan Plateau and roughly 500,000 km2 in High Asia based on observations of prominent features of LGM glacier extension, may be the direct evidence that shows there was no Quaternary unified ice sheet developed in the Tibetan Plateau.},
