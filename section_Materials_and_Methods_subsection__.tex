\subsection{Clade selection and phylogeny reconstruction}

We selected 18 clades of vascular plants that best met our criteria: each clade (1) included a substantial number of species that occur in the Hengduan Mountains, as well as species that occur elsewhere; (2) had sufficient molecular data available to infer a phylogeny that is broadly representative of the clade's taxonomic diversity and geographic range; and (3) had fossil data suitable for molecular clock calibration. The clades include angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns, and together include XXX species, of which YYY could be sampled for phylogeny reconstruction (SI REF). For each clade, we assembled molecular sequences and fossil data and generated a Bayesian posterior sample of time-calibrated phylogenies and the associated maximum-clade-credibility tree (SI REF).

\subsection{Ancestral range inference}

For each clade we randomly drew 500 trees from the posterior
