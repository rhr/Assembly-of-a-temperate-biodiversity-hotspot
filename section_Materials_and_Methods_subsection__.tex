\subsection{Clade selection and phylogeny reconstruction}

We selected 18 clades of vascular plants that best met our criteria: each clade (1) included a substantial number of species that occur in the Hengduan Mountains, as well as species that occur elsewhere; (2) had sufficient molecular data available to infer a phylogeny that is broadly representative of the clade's taxonomic diversity and geographic range; and (3) had fossil data suitable for molecular clock calibration. The clades include angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns, and together include XXX species, of which YYY could be sampled for phylogeny reconstruction (SI REF). For each clade, we assembled molecular sequences and fossil data and generated a Bayesian posterior sample of time-calibrated phylogenies and the associated maximum-clade-credibility tree (SI REF).

\subsection{Ancestral range inference}

For each clade, we inferred biogeographic histories using the DEC model of range evolution implemented in Lagrange (Ree and Smith 2008). For this we defined 11 biogeographic regions to accommodate the global distribution of our species sample, and for each species in our phylogenetic sample, we scored its geographic range as presence-absence in these regions (SI REF). We 

For each clade, we randomly drew 500 trees from the Bayesian posterior sample
