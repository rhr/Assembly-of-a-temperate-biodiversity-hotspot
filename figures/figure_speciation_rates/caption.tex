\label{fig:speciation}
Rolling estimates of \textit{in situ} speciation rates through time for the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas-QTP regions from inferred biogeographic histories of 18 plant clades. Lines indicate medians and shaded areas indicate 5--95\% quantile intervals from 500 pseudoreplicated joint histories designed to account for phylogenetic uncertainty (see text). Regional rates begin to diverge about 8 Ma, with the Hengduan Mountains showing a striking increase in \textit{in situ} speciation relative to the Himalayas-QTP.
