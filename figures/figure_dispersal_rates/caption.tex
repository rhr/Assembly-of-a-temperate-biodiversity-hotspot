\label{fig:dispersal}
Rolling estimates of colonization rates through time for the Hengduan Mountains, Himalayas-QTP, and temperate/boreal East Asia regions from inferred biogeographic histories of 18 plant clades. Lines indicate medians and shaded areas indicate 5â€“95\% quantile intervals from 500 pseudoreplicated joint histories designed to account for phylogenetic uncertainty (see text). Dispersal between the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas-QTP increases in the last 2 Ma relative to dispersal between either region and temperate/boreal East Asia.
