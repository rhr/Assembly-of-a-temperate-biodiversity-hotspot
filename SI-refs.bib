  abstract     = {The genus Rosa (roses) comprises approximately 190
                  shrub species distributed widely throughout the
                  temperate and subtropical habitats of the northern
                  hemisphere. Despite numerous recent studies
                  examining phylogenetic relationships in the genus,
                  relationships remain obscure due to problems such as
                  poor identification of garden specimens,
                  hybridization in nature and in the garden, and low
                  levels of chloroplast and nuclear genome
                  variation. Phylogenetic analyses of non-coding
                  chloroplast sequences from the trnL-F region and
                  psbA-trnH intergenic spacer for 70 taxa show
                  slightly more variation than previous analyses of
                  the genus. Bayesian and parsimony analyses suggest
                  that subg. Rosa can be divided into two large
                  clades, each with low internal resolution. One
                  comprises species from sections Carolinae,
                  Cinnamomeae and Pimpinellifoliae p.p., whilst the
                  other consists of all of the remaining sections of
                  subg. Rosa (Banksianae p.p., Bracteatae, Caninae,
                  Indicae, Laevigatae, Rosa, Synstylae and
                  Pimpinellifoliae p.p.). A fairly complete sampling
                  of field-collected North American taxa has been
                  incorporated in this analysis. Analyses indicate
                  that migration into North America occurred at least
                  twice within this primarily Old World genus. Most
                  North American taxa, except R. setigera and
                  R. minutifolia, fall into a single clade that
                  includes Asian and European taxa. Analyses also are
                  consistent with the notion that cultivated
                  commercial roses have a relatively narrow genetic
                  background. Six of the seven primary taxa believed
                  to be involved in the creation of domesticated roses
                  are found within the same large clade that mostly
                  includes Asian and European taxa.},

  abstract     = {The taxonomy and phylogeny of Asian Meconopsis
                  (Himalayan blue poppy) remain largely unresolved. We
                  used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of
                  nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and the chloroplast
                  DNA (cpDNA) trnL-F region for phylogenetic
                  reconstruction of Meconopsis and its close relatives
                  Papaver, Roemeria, and Stylomecon. We identified
                  five main clades, which were well-supported in the
                  gene trees reconstructed with the nrDNA ITS and
                  cpDNA trnL-F sequences. We found that 41 species of
                  Asian Meconopsis did not constitute a monophyletic
                  clade, but formed two solid clades (I and V)
                  separated in the phylogenetic tree by three clades
                  (II, III and IV) of Papaver and its allies. Clade V
                  includes only four Asian Meconopsis species, with
                  the remaining 90 percent of Asian species included
                  in clade I. In this core Asian Meconopsis clade,
                  five subclades (Ia–Ie) were recognized in the nrDNA
                  ITS tree. Three species (Meconopsis discigera,
                  M. pinnatifolia, and M. torquata) of subgenus
                  Discogyne were imbedded in subclade Ia, indicating
                  that the present definition of subgenera in
                  Meconopsis should be rejected. These subclades are
                  inconsistent with any series or sections of the
                  present classifications, suggesting that
                  classifications of the genus should be completely
                  revised. Finally, proposals for further revision of
                  the genus Meconopsis were put forward based on
                  molecular, morphological, and biogeographical
                  evidences.},

  abstract     = {The Hengduan Mountains (H-D Mountains) in China
                  flank the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau
                  (Q–T Plateau) and are a center of great temperate
                  plant diversity. The geological history and complex
                  topography of these mountains may have prompted the
                  in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly
                  endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D
                  Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain
                  regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One
                  hypothesis is that the Q–T Plateau underwent a
                  final, rapid phase of uplift 8–7 million years ago
                  (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a
                  separate event occurring 4–3 Mya. To evaluate this
                  hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic,
                  biogeographic, divergence time dating, and
                  diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally
                  important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The
                  Lilium–Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout
                  the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most
                  diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q–T
                  Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support
                  previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested
                  within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence
                  between the two gene trees which may result from
                  hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the
                  ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major
                  lineages within Lilium–Nomocharis may be temporally
                  coincident with Q–T Plateau uplift occurring 8–7 Mya
                  and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4–3 Mya. Our
                  analyses of diversification times and rates among
                  Lilium–Nomocharis clades are less
                  conclusive. However, these do suggest high
                  extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.},
