\section{Discussion}

Our analysis is the first to make quantitative inferences about the relative contributions of \textit{in situ} lineage diversification and colonization to the assembly of one of the world's richest temperate floras, that of the Hengduan Mountains. Despite precedent in the literature for considering the Hengduan Mountains to be merely part of a single larger biogeographic region that includes the Himalayas, we find that the 2 regions actually have very distinct histories of assembly. We expected to find that their histories of assembly matched their histories of orogeny; that is, in situ speciation and colonization
