\significancestatement{Why do so many species occur in mountains? A
  popular but little-tested hypothesis is that tectonic uplift creates
  environmental conditions (new habitats, dispersal barriers, etc.)
  that increase the rate at which resident species divide and evolve
  to form new ones. In China's Hengduan Mountains region, a
  biodiversity hotspot uplifted over the last 8 million years, this
  rate does in fact show a significant increase during that time,
  relative to the rate for adjacent older mountains, and to the rate
  of species immigration. The Hengduan Mountains flora is thus made up
  disproportionately of species that evolved within the region during
  its uplift, supporting the original hypothesis and helping to
  explain the prevalence of mountains as global biodiversity
  hotspots.}

\begin{abstract}
  A common hypothesis for the rich biodiversity found in mountains is
  uplift-driven diversification---that orogeny creates conditions
  favoring rapid \textit{in situ} speciation of resident lineages. We
  tested this hypothesis in the context of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
  (QTP) and adjoining mountain ranges, using the phylogenetic and
  geographic histories of multiple groups of plants to infer the tempo
  (rate) and mode (colonization vs.\ \textit{in situ} diversification)
  of biotic assembly through time and across regions. We focused on
  the Hengduan Mountains region, which in comparison to the QTP and
  Himalayas was uplifted more recently (since the late Miocene), is
  smaller in area, and richer in species. The time-calibrated
  phylogenetic analyses showed that about 8 million years ago, the
  rate of \textit{in situ} diversification increased in the Hengduan
  Mountains, significantly exceeding that in the geologically older
  QTP and Himalayas. By contrast, in the QTP and Himalayas during the
  same period, the rate of \textit{in situ} diversification remained
  relatively flat, with colonization dominating lineage
  accumulation. The Hengduan Mountains flora was thus assembled
  disproportionately by recent \textit{in situ} diversification,
  temporally congruent with independent estimates of orogeny. This is
  the first study to show quantitative evidence for uplift-driven
  diversification in this region, and more generally, to test the
  hypothesis by comparing the rate and mode of biotic assembly jointly
  across time and space. It thus complements the more prevalent method
  of examining endemic radiations individually, and could be used as a
  template to augment such studies in other biodiversity hotspots.

\caption{Assembly of regional floras by colonization and \textit{in
    situ} speciation events in 19 plant clades, inferred from
  ancestral-range reconstructions on time-calibrated molecular
  phylogenies. Shaded regions indicate the 5--95\% quantile intervals
  for the cumulative number of events through time from 500
  pseudoreplicated joint biogeographic histories designed to account
  for phylogenetic uncertainty (see text). Panels on the right focus
  on the last 20 Ma, in which differences in regional assembly are
  most apparent. In the Hengduan Mountains region, cumulative
  \textit{in situ} speciation overtakes colonization about 8 Ma,
  whereas for the Himalayas-QTP, colonization remains the dominant
  process. \textit{In situ} speciation thus appears to have played a
  disproportionately large role in assembling the Hengduan Mountains
  flora since the late Miocene compared to the Himalayas-QTP,
  consistent with the theory of uplift-driven diversification in the
  Hengduan Mountains region.}

  diversification rate in the mid-to-late Miocene.}
