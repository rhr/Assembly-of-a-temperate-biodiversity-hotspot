\subsection{Results}

We obtained time-calibrated molecular phylogenies for 18 clades, sampling a total of 3,266 ingroup species of which 899 occur in the Hengduan Mountains, 628 in the Himalayas, and 1,165 in temperate East Asia. The proportion of species sampled was roughly the same across these regions, in the range of 50--60\% (SI REF).

Given the geological view that the Hengduan Mountains are younger than the Himalayas, we expected to find evidence that its flora was assembled more recently. Instead, we found surprisingly deep phylogenetic histories of Hengduan occupancy. Colonization of the Hengduan Mountains began XX--YY Mya and in situ speciation began 70-35 Mya (95\% quantiles of 100 pseudoreplicates).
